        <p>
            HTTP messages are the foundation of web development. Web browsers and HTTP clients such as cURL create
            HTTP request messages that are sent to a web server, which provides an HTTP response message.
            Server-side code receives an HTTP request message, and returns an HTTP response message.
        </p>

            </a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Middleware is code that exists between the request and response, and which can take the incoming
            request, perform actions based on it, and either complete the response or pass delegation on to the
            next middleware in the queue. Your application is easily extended with custom middleware created by
            yourself or <a href="https://packagist.org/search/?q=middleware" target="_blank">others</a>.
